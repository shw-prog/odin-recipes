    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Here is a simple but delicious crepe batter which can be made in minutes. It's made from ingredients that everyone has on hand.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</p></li>
        <li><h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</p></li>
    </ol>
